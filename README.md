# Bus Booking App

This project is a mobile application for booking bus seats. It features a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to select their route, check seat availability, and view the location in real-time.

## Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Maksim-creator/transport-service.git](https://github.com/Maksim-creator/transport-service.git)
cd transportService
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Run the project

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
